This is an md file describes the details about referred files.

**animationTool.py** <br />
It is a Python tool used for visualizing code executions. It was developed to create an animation in the Spyder environment by reading data from Excel files generated after running the "**(version name)_animation.cpp**" codes.

**v1.cpp**<br />
It covers the density source addition and density diffusion sections in Jos Stam's paper.

**v1_animation.cpp**<br />
It provides the necessary Excel files as output to generate the animation for the code v1.

**v2.cpp**<br />
It covers the density source addition, density diffusion, and density advection sections in Jos Stam paper.

**v2_animation.cpp**<br />
It provides the necessary Excel files as output to generate the animation for the code v2.

**v3.cpp**<br />
It covers the density and velocity source addition, density and velocity diffusion, density and velocity advection, and **Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition** sections in Jos Stam paper.

**v4.cpp**<br />
It covers the density and velocity source addition, density and velocity diffusion, density and velocity advection, **Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition** and setting boundary conditions sections in Jos Stam paper.

**v4_animation.cpp**<br />
It provides the necessary Excel files as output to generate the animation for the code v4.
